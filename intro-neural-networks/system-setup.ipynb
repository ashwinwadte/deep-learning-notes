    "    **Note:** Anaconda is a fairly large download (~500 MB) because it comes with the most common data science packages in Python. If you don't need all the packages or need to conserve bandwidth or storage space, there is also `Miniconda`, a smaller distribution that includes only `conda` - a package and environment manager and Python. You can still install any of the available packages with conda, it just doesn't come with them.\n",
